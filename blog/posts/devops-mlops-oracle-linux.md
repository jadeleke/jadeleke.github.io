# DevOps, MLOps, Oracle DBA, and Linux Sysadmin — How They Fit Together

I wear a few hats: DevOps Engineer, MLOps Engineer, Oracle Database Administrator (DBA), and Linux System Administrator. This combo helps me design, build, and operate end‑to‑end systems that ship reliable features and models.

## DevOps

- CI/CD pipelines (build, test, deploy)
- Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Observability (logs, metrics, tracing) and incident response

## MLOps

- Experiment tracking and model registry (MLflow)
- Reproducible training pipelines (Airflow) and artifacts
- Serving (REST/gRPC), autoscaling, canary/blue‑green deploys

## Oracle DBA

- Installation, upgrades, patching, backups, and recovery
- Performance tuning, query optimization, and capacity planning
- High availability and security best practices

## Linux Sysadmin

- System hardening, users/permissions, and automation (Bash)
- Networking, storage, and process management
- Troubleshooting with built‑in tooling

## Putting It Together

These skills align into a single goal: robust, observable platforms that support data‑driven products. I care about reproducibility, reliability, and speed — from database to deployment, from feature pipelines to production inference.
