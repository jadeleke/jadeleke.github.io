MLOps sits at the intersection of machine learning, software engineering, and operations. Iâ€™m interested in productionizing models, streamlining CI/CD for ML, and building reliable data/serving pipelines.

On this blog, Iâ€™ll share notes and examples on topics like:

- Containerizing models (Docker) and serving at scale (Kubernetes)
- Model registries and experiment tracking (MLflow)
- Feature/data pipelines and orchestration (Airflow)
- CI/CD for ML (training, validation, deployment)
- Observability, metrics, and drift detection

Stay tuned!
